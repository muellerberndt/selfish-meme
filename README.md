In this reverse engineering project, I model reality linguistically, as a computational process that evolves a way of creating itself. In other words, reality is *literally* the self-answering question: What would a reality that creates itself be like?

I integrate the concepts of mind and matter and connect information to causality via observation. Finally, I propose an architecture that would allow such realities to emerge: A quantum computer that evolves ideas until the idea of simulating more realities is found, simulating reality itself in a strange loop.
