# The Selfish Meme

In this reverse engineering project, I model Reality linguistically, as a set of self-creating sentences written in a set of self-evolving theories (languages). I integrate the concepts of mind and matter and connect information to causality via observation. Finally, I propose an architecture that would allow such Realities to emerge: A quantum computer that evolves ideas until the idea of simulating more Realities is found, resulting in an infinite amount of Realities simulating other Realities, eventually including all possible Realities (each one carved out by the free will of those Realitiesâ€™ participants).

I propose that:

- The Simulation Hypothesis is true;
- The Multiverse Hypothesis is true;
- All that really exists is possible Realities emerging without a first cause;
- Awareness is an inherent property of our Universe;
- Mind is primary and everything happens for a reason.

If you have ideas, please create issues and make pull requests. Tnis is supposed to be a theory by everyone.
